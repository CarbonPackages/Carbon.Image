# Carbon.Image Package for Neos CMS

This package provides some fusion helper for images; you have to create the node type for yourself. Here you see an example of an implementation: [Jonnitto.Image](https://github.com/jonnitto/Jonnitto.Image) or [Jonnitto.ImagesInARow](https://github.com/jonnitto/Jonnitto.ImagesInARow)

## Installation

Most of the time you have to make small adjustments to a package (e.g. configuration in `Settings.yaml`). Because of that, it is important to add the corresponding package to the composer from your theme package. Mostly this is the site packages located under `Packages/Sites/`. To install it correctly go to your theme package (e.g.`Packages/Sites/Foo.Bar`) and run following command:

```
composer require carbon/image --no-update
```

The `--no-update` command prevent the automatic update of the dependencies. After the package was added to your theme `composer.json`, go back to the root of the Neos installation and run `composer update`. Et voil√†! Your desired package is now installed correctly.
