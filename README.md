# Carbon.Image Package for Neos CMS

This package provides some fusion helper for images; you have to create the node type for yourself. Here you see an example of an implementation: [Jonnitto.Image] or [Jonnitto.ImagesInARow]

## Installation

Most of the time you have to make small adjustments to a package (e.g. configuration in `Settings.yaml`). Because of that, it is important to add the corresponding package to the composer from your theme package. Mostly this is the site packages located under `Packages/Sites/`. To install it correctly go to your theme package (e.g.`Packages/Sites/Foo.Bar`) and run following command:

```
composer require carbon/image --no-update
```

The `--no-update` command prevent the automatic update of the dependencies. After the package was added to your theme `composer.json`, go back to the root of the Neos installation and run `composer update`. Et voil√†! Your desired package is now installed correctly.

## NodeTypes

Below a list of which NodeTypes Mixins you can use in your projects:

### [`Carbon.Image:Image`]

This abstract node type (a.k.a. mixin) create the property and the inspector group `image`.

### [`Carbon.Image:Title`]

This mixin create a input field in the inspector for the property named `title`.

### [`Carbon.Image:AlternativeText`]

This mixin create a input field in the inspector for the property named `alternativeText`.

### [`Carbon.Image:Lightbox`]

This mixin create a checkbox to enlarge picture with a click. The name of the property is `lightbox`. Works great with [Jonnitto.PhotoSwipe].

### [`Carbon.Image:Caption`]

This mixin create a input field in the inspector for the property named `caption`.

### [`Carbon.Image:Link`]

This mixin with the property named `link` create a link editor in the inspector where you can add external and internal links and also links to assets.

### [`Carbon.Image:BackendLabel`]

This mixin don't create a property. It is just here to create the label for the backend in the structure tree
